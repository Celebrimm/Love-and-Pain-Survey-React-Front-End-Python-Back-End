      This experiment was created to test a hypothesis: people who are in love
      have a higher pain threshold than people who are not. Love survey's
      first fifteen questions are made for the sole purpose of giving the
      participant stimuli about the participant's lover. By focusing the
      participants attention on their lover we can then administer pain
      questions to see if being in love has an affect on their pain threshold.
      People who are not in love or do not wish to take the Love survey are
      given the Pain survey. The Pain survey's sole purpose is to test the
      participants pain threshold. The bar chart above reflects the comparison
      of results between participants who took the Love survey versus
      participants who took the Pain survey. These results were determined by
      a level of caution scale evaluating answer choices in the pain portion of
      each survey. Most Likely being the highest level of caution (5) and Very
      unlikely being the lowest level of caution (1) with the exception of the
      last two questions (opposite answer values). Every participants average
      level of caution were added to a pool of other participants' results based
      on the version of the survey they submitted (Love or Pain). The
      average was then taken for each version's pool of results and displayed in
      the bar chart above.
