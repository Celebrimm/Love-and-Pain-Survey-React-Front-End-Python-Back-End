      The purpose of this experiment is to see if people who take the love
      questions before the pain questions (Version: Love and Pain) are going to
      answer more prudently when answering questions in the pain portion of the
      survey as opposed to the people who just took the pain questions(Version:
      Pain).It is believed that when people are made to think about a loved one
      before being asked questions about how they would react in painful
      situations, that they would answer the pain questions more prudently.
      Therefore the first portion of the version "Love and Pain" is dedicated to
      asking you questions about your loved one. The answer values that are
      being evaluated(pain portion of the survey) are based on a level of
      caution scale. Most Likely being the highest level of caution(5) and Very
      unlikely being the lowest level of caution(1) with the exception of the
      last two questions. The last two questions are taking the opposite values.
      Every participants average level of caution and their respective version
      were then taken and added to a pool of other participants results. The
      overall result for each version posted on the graph above was given by the
      average of each versions pool of results.
